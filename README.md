## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This account is an Alternative Project Account meant to inspire people to create random things for the gaming community.

The first project I made is called **Squad-Gambling** with seperate repositories for **Backend** and **Frontend**. I don't know how much I will go into detail with this, but I really like this idea of gambling on video games. Not loot boxes obviously, but an introduction to the idea that gambling does happen and it is one of the oldest forms of gaming.
